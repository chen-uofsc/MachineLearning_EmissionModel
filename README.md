# MachineLearning_EmissionModel
A surrogate emission rate model for MOVES

Traffic simulations were excuted using SUMO with real-world based road network of the City of Columbia in SC.

Emission data were obtained by running MOVES 2014b with fine-granualarity input.
## Datasets:
ModelInput_urbanstreet.csv: Contains samples of urban street traffic patterns and emission data from MOVES
ModelInput_urbanstreet.csv: Contains samples of urban street traffic patterns and emission data from MOVES

The traffic data are the link level aggregated values of the vehicle trajectories generated using SUMO based on Columbia city in SC.

## Notebook:
Contains code for training models, testing models, and randomforest model for testing feature importance.

Notebook is incorporated with Google Colab and can be run using Colab GPUs.
